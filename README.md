An informative app for anyone to prepare against potential floods

## Features

# 1) Areas under high flood-risk (teal/cyan - area) 
(city center, Zurich/CH)
These areas are expected to go under-water when the water elevation rises by 1-2 m. This includes risks from the following:
* A typical Zurich flood goes up to 1.5 m above the current waterline (at 406 m).
* Within the next 100 years, water elevation in Europe is expected to rise by 1-2 m.

# 2) Contour lines (purple - line)
(Zurich/CH)
